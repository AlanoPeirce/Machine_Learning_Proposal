# Proposal for a Machine Learning Solution

The included document is a proposal for a machine learning solution that is capable of autonomously categorizing images of wildlife into predefined species classifications.

The proposal includes:

* Extensive research into the efficacy rates of ML solutions in similar scenarios
* The scope and objectives of the project
* A detailed description of the methodology that will be used (the SEMMA methodology)
* A projected timeline, sprint schedule, and an exhaustive itemization of the resources required and resulting costs
* An extensive explanation of the ML algorithm that will be used (the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm)
* A description of the data collection method to be used as well as concerns regarding the extracted data set
* Many other components that are not listed here
